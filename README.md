### Building and running locally

1. Ensure pre-requisites:
    1. [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
    1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install)
1. Fork repository
1. Clone
1. (Recommended) Open in editor such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
1. Add GitHub > **User** and **[AuthenticationToken](https://github.com/settings/tokens)** to Fritz.StreamTools\appsettings.json (no scopes needed)
1. Run `dotnet build .\Fritz.StreamTools.sln` to confirm build success
    1. If error: *A compatible SDK version for global.json version*, update the version in global.json to match your .NET version.
    1. If error: *\Fritz.StreamTools\Test\Test.csproj : error NU1605: Detected package downgrade*, update the version numbers to match what is expected based on the error.
1. Run `docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" -f "docker-compose.override.yml" up -d --build`
1. Run `docker ps` to find the port (for example: "32768" in "0.0.0.0:32768->80/tcp")
1. Browse to http://localhost[port]

## Configuration

### Google Fonts Api

To use your own Google Fonts Api key without modifying the `Fritz.StreamTools\appSettings.json` you can place your key in the `secrets.json` file in the [path appropriate for your OS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio#how-the-secret-manager-tool-works).

The *userSecretsId* is **78c713a0-80e0-4e16-956a-33cf16f08a02** and can be found in `Fritz.StreamTools\Fritz.StreamTools.csproj`.

If you are using Visual Studio you can use the [integrated User Secrets management UI](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mihansen/2017/09/10/managing-secrets-in-net-core-2-0-apps/)

The `secrets.json` file should look like this

    {
      "GoogleFontsApi": {
        "Key": "<YOUR API KEY>"
      }
    }

### Naming guideline for unit tests

*  Create a folder for each "logical class"
*  Create a test class for each feature to test - end with "Should"
*  Test Methods should describe what they are inspecting and what they're given, if anything.. ending with "\_Given..."
Example: StreamService.CurrentFollowerCountShould.MatchCurrentFollowerCount_GivenOneService
